          <p>Maybe, you’re wondering why more and more websites or applications are looking the same <i>(with a top navigation bar and some left aligned logo for example)</i>? Have you ever noticed that most of them are also using the same Javascript functions and CSS classes when you inspect them? Weird? Not really! The reason behind this is that most of them are using the same front-end development frameworks.
          <br><br>
          We are assisting since few years to a massive standardization of the web. It started with semantic tags in HTML5 and those inspired talented developers who had a vision of web design to create full front-end solutions such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>. Make no mistake, I’ve been using front-end frameworks for a year, and I can tell about their advantages and benefits. For instance, Bootstrap is amazing, it provides a wide set of code samples, making you able to build a website with complex features from scratch in less than an hour. Moreover, everybody starts to knows the name of classes of this framework, so when you work as a front-end developer with some back-end developers, it have the advantage of being known already by everyone in the team (like a universal code!). In fact, running a bootstrap project is easy and the package already comes with the jQuery lib installed, an optimized CSS stylesheet (and the possibility to use SASS or LESS). Again, bootstrap provides everything you need and even more, you may need in the future, making it a kind of new standard of web design.<br><br>
          So what is the problem? Although most of those items are customizable, both in code and on the bootstrap download page, I am a little concerned by the adverse consequence this new format may have in the future of user experience. Even if some frameworks are incredible time-saving design tools I cannot stop myself from thinking we should not fully use them any time we make a project (just like we tend to do those days).<br><br>
          Yes, we are getting lazy, but it’s not the main problem. Because frameworks are ready-to-work visual user interface components you can tailor to your own needs, they also play the role of navigation elements and determine how users will behave on your website. One should consider this more before one starts working with a framework. At, this step, you may think that I’m talking about re-inventing the wheel. And, you maybe be right to use this metaphor because it is very appropriate in some way: “why should we bother re-creating (in worse most of the time) what already exists when it is already here and ready-to-go?”. Maybe, because IT and car industry have nothing in common when it comes to innovation. I like to believe that we belong to an industry, that is permanently evolving and trying to provide solutions to new problems or people potential needs. By essence, the nature of this industry is that that we have to go further that what just “works” when we can because we want to come up with useful, new and original products.<br><br>
          Few solutions that, I think, our industry front-end developers would consider in order to make a better or at least more careful use of front-end frameworks and prevent us from falling into a fully-standardized font-end code environment could be: Using just what we need in term of resources (pick some features), not necessary using full framework will make your project lighter. That matters when deploying applications. When working with an existing framework one should always try to understand the way it works over blindly using it because it’s cool and have a wow-effect. Learning more about famous frameworks mechanics will one day help one making his own framework. Then, highly customize it, so it doesn’t look like the out-of-the box framework, otherwise your projects maybe looks un-finished or worse, a little cheap. Finally, keep in mind that framework are just here to help. Of course everyone will want to get the most out of it. But first, stick to wire-frames, interaction mock-ups and what teams originally had in mind during the creative process and try going beyond framework features. I truly believe that implementing extra-features and libraries may really enrich our industry’s projects and design approach in the future.
