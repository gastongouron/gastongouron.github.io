        <h3>About static sites</h3>
        <p>I did my first webpage when I was fourteen and, since that day, I have seen the internet changing and improving year after years in terms of readability, accessibility and quality of contents. Trust me, there are no reasons for it to stop evolving and if you compare today's web standards to those of the 2000's you can see what I talk about. Since always, personal websites are built statically, which means, their content is added manually by their admins, and every page is individually created by a someone. Hence, a static website is the opposite of a web application (which creates pages based on dynamic contents). So, if you have a basic knowledge with HTML, CSS and are curious person, you already fill all the requirements to create your personal static site.</p>

       <h3>Get started!</h3>
        <p>Contrary to what many people things, coding is not the starting point and that's the reason why you shouldn't start by focusing on trying to find "solutions" that don't require too much coding, such as content managing systems. For me, coding shouldn't be your main concern at this point because, you first need to have an overview of what you want to create and what it involves creating it. You're jumping into a new adventure and you want to make a plan to successfully achieve your ends without going mad. Below is a common process for website creation:<br><br>

        <b>1. Define your minimal product:</b> This first part of your work is probably the most important and consists in making an ordered list of your priorities and of the most important features you want to implement to your site. At this step you can ask to yourself some questions such as "Do I want it to be responsive?", "Do I want to use PHP and a webserver to work with dynamic data?", "What kind of content do I want to use?", "Do I need a CMS for this?", and every questions you think can have an impact on the develoopement of your project. I usually do this in a .txt file but you can also do it with a pen and a piece of paper. Because I believe you are going to work for yourself here, this document is the only thing you will have to refer to so it's important making it as good and detailled as you can. You will come back to edit it often as it's going to become your TO-DO list.<br><br>

         <b>2. Visualize it:</b> Now, it's time to materialize your idea visually. Draw something! If you don't like drawing/prototyping, you can also make a mood-board in order to glean inspiration on other websites. I advice you to do both: start by picking a few websites where you web components that you like ("Ew, I like this menu", "What a nice footer", and so on..) and, then, referring to your minimal product definition, incorporate this into a very basic layout. At this step, it's not needed to sketch too much about interaction design and elements behaviors, but you can always think about it! Now, you start to have an overall idea about the pieces you will have to put together to build your dream site.<br><br>

         <b>3. Create your sandbox and start playing with code:</b> Based on your website contents types, layouts, and your objectives, it's time to create templates for your pages. In a text editor, try to add textual and media contents to an index.html page and start to organise the structure of the information in your page. Once done, create one of every element your site will require, for example, a link, an article, an image, a nav pill, a contact form...   At this step, your page background is white and your typeface is set to Arial but you start to populate your website with various elements.<br><br>

         <b>4. Cascading Swag Sheets and elements behaviors</b>
         As a front-end web developer, you start to understand that your site is not very visually interesting without an extra layer of styling and scripting. Now, you want to customize your site and make it more interactive. To do this, you have few options, the best one in my humble opinion is learning CSS positionning and global element styling properties in order to make your page looks the exact way you want. By the way, it can take time but there is nothing more satisfying than doing it yourself. Sames goes for page interactions, if you are eager to learn what's happenning behind the scenes, you will want to learn some JavaScript or at least jQuery to manipulate the DOM elements. If you have no time to devote to styling your site manually, you can try to use a front-end framework and playing around with it by reading the documentation and implementing fresh and high-end designed components onto your website. Both options are good and really depends on your time and motivations. Once you're done, integrate your content on every page and go live!<br><br>


         <b>5. Refactor the code and fine-tune your site look-n-feel:</b>
         Making a pixel-perfect website working on every devices an browsers the way it's intended to is a long process and requires some experience. This is the reason why your first vesion will probably not look as good as those highly fashionable websites you see on awwwards. It's not a reason to lower the arms! Here are some hints to help you while working on your website during every part of the web-development process in order to be sure everything is as good as it have to be:
         <ul>
          <li><b>Use Devtools:</b> If you don't use Google chrome yet, download it and use right click on any element of any site in order to inspect it. Very useful to find errors adn debug.</li>
          <li><b>Test different screen sizes:</b> There is nothing worst than a website that don't display the way it should. Play with browser window size in order to see how users with lower screen sizes see your site. Fix what have to be fixed to have control on how you site displays on different screen sizes.</li>
          <li><b>Use different browsers:</b> Open your site on (at least) Firefox and Chrome, to see how users who use different browsers see your site and how it can affect their experience. If you are not happy with what you see, fix it.</li>
          <li><b>Steal code:</b> Chrome devtools in an incredible tool every web-developper uses to understand how other sites works. Go on sites that you like and inspect them. If you feel like you understand how the feature you like is made, copy it and work from that.</li>
         </ul>
