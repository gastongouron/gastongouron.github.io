  <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
    <p>
      What? You’ve never heard of <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git</a>? Do you know what, before yesterday morning, me neither! To be honest version control is amazing! Erm, let me tell you more... Version control is some crazy software wizardry that allows you to manage and keep an eye on every changes you make on any file of a project.
      <br>
      But, what are the benefits of version control? Okay, imagine a world where you can live in several different lives in addition to a main one. In those parallel lives <i>(branches)</i>, you can perform different actions such as trying to reach your ultimate goal: become a full-stack web developer. Now imagine that in one of those lives you achieve particular actions that leads you to that goal. In the world of version control <i>(git)</i>, you can decide to make this sucessfull life become your main one <i>(merge)</i> by using a command line. By the way it’s even more powerful than that. For instance, if you realize few days after that becoming that full-stack web developer doesn’t make you happy, you can "undo changes", switch back to an other life from the past <i>(old commit)</i>, making you traveling into time. Can you see the benefits now?
      <br>
      More seriously, it can look difficult to learn how to perform simple actions with git and gitHub (such as pushing a repo) but after two days I can say that it’s not that hard and it’s totally worth it. Learning and practising those skills will help you to perform tasks you can't possibly imagine perform with the graphical user interface. Moreover, it makes you work a lot safer because you don't have to manage your files manually. Finally, learning those skills will make you feel like a powerful programmer wizarding on servers with a shell, just like in a computer movie of the 80’s.

      <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
      <p>
      Git is a software that allows you to look back in time and see what happened since your first commit or cloned repo, simply by using shell commands. For example, when using the git log command, the shell will return you useful informations such as the commit title, id, autor and date.
      <br>
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-log">This command</a>, if used with appropriates options and arguments can be very handy to achieve tedious tasks such as finding what you are looking for in a large amount of files.
    </p>
    <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> is an "extension" of git magical powers. It works exactly on the same principles, but with git, instead of working locally you work on remote servers. Behind the simple idea of being a directory (a.k.a repositories or “repos”) hub, Github provides a wonderful set of build-in options. First of all, the configuration of default ’s repository is public and initialized with a license file, generally making the code fully open source. The idea behind this is to give a “social” web platform for developers to collaborate at a world-wide level.
      <br>
      Secondary gitHub is having a function of portfolio in the IT community, it will show what technologies you are abble to work with, and what you are capable of doing with them. Finally, gitHub is probably the most interesting and advanced way to create any kind of web project because it works like permanent iterator for your project. Perhaps, one day, one of your project can arouse passion in the developers’ community and give you the opportunity to collaborate with new people!
