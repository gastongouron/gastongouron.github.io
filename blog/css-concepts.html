        <h3>Why using ID's and Classes in CSS?</h3>
        <p>Even if basic HTML elements like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> offers basic display properties, our basic set of tags doesn't cover every possible layout needs you will encounter. This is the reason why you will often want to use id’s and classes. CSS obviously needs these so that we may build selectors and do our styling, but other web languages like Javascript depend on them too. So, what is the difference between them?</p>

        <h3>They are differents</h3>
        <p><b>ID's are unique</b>, each element can have only one ID and each page can have only one element with that ID. <b>Classes are not unique</b>, you can use the same class on multiple elements and multiple classes on the same element:</p>

   <div class="info-inner">
                <pre><code>&lt;div class="project"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="project"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can now use the class name "project" as your hook to apply the same set of styling to each one of these. But what if you need one of them to be bigger than the other, but still share all the other attributes? Classes has you covered there, as you can apply more than one class:</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;div class="project"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="project big"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
        </div>
<p>No need to make a brand new class name here, just apply a new class right in the class attribute. These classes are space delimited and most browsers support any number of them (actually, it's more like thousands, but way more than you'll ever need). There are no browser defaults for any ID or Class.<br><br>In fact, <b>ID's have special browser functionality.</b> Classes have no special abilities in the browser, but ID's do have one very important trick up their sleeve. This is the "hash value" in the URL. If you have a URL like http://yourdomain.com#comments, the browser will attempt to locate the element with an ID of "comments" and will automatically scroll the page to show that element. It is important to note here that the browser will scroll whatever element it needs to in order to show that element, so if you did something special like a scrollable DIV area within your regular body, that div will be scrolled too.
This is an important reason right here why having ID's be absolutely unique is important. So your browser knows where to scroll!
</p>

        <h3>You can, and will use both on same elements</h3>
        <p>
There is nothing stopping you from having both an ID and a Class on a single element. In fact, it is often a very good idea, I generally used classes for pure styling purposes and ids for scripts purposes, just like:
<div class="info-inner">
                <pre><code>&lt;div class="project" id="uniqueProjectName"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            </div>
        </div>
<p>
<b>CSS doesn't care:</b>
regarding CSS, there is nothing you can do with an ID that you can't do with a Class and vise versa. I remember when I was first learning CSS and I was having a problem, sometimes I would try and troubleshoot by switching around these values. Nope. CSS doesn't care. <b>Javascript cares:</b>
JavaScript people are already probably more in tune with the differences between classes and ID's. JavaScript depends on there being only one page element with any particular, or else the commonly used getElementById function wouldn't be dependable. For those familiar with jQuery, you know how easy it is to add and remove classes to page elements. It is a native and built in function of jQuery. Notice how no such function exists for ID's. It is not the responsibility of JavaScript to manipulate these values, it would cause more problems than it would be worth.

As you can see, classes and ID's are very important and we rely on them every day to do the styling and page manipulation that we need to do. However, you should use them judiciously and semantically so if you don’t need them, don’t use them!
